1. For this project I first prepared the data using the `StandardScaler()` module from `scikit-learn` to normalize the data from the csv file
2. Then I created a dataframe using Pandas
3. Next I found the best k value using a for loop
4. Next I created an elbow curve to visually identify the optimal value for k
5. Then I created predicted clusters by plotting a scatter plot using hvPlot
6. Then I performed a PCA and reduced the features to three principal components
7. Last I found the best value for k using the PCA dataFrame
